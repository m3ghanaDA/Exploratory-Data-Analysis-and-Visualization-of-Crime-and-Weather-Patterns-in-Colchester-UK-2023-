## 2. Data Collection
### Datasets:
1. **Crime Dataset (crime23.csv)**:
   - Includes crime categories, dates, geographic coordinates, and outcomes.
2. **Weather Dataset (temp2023.csv)**:
   - Contains daily temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and other weather metrics.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
### Crime Data Cleaning:
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., `context`).
- Converted categorical variables (e.g., `category`, `outcome_status`) to factors.
- Addressed missing values:
  - Eliminated incomplete records or imputed missing values where feasible.

### Weather Data Cleaning:
- Removed redundant columns (e.g., `PreselevHp`).
- Converted columns like `WindkmhDir` to factors.
- Imputed missing values with mean for variables such as precipitation and cloudiness.
